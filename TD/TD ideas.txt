		FlameThrower
		Eletric gun
		Boat (water levels??) 
		Tank
		Morter/Airstrike

	Targeting
		Multiple targeting systems:
			Most Hp
			Furthest
			Targeted



	Current:
		Turret:
			Medium atk speed
			low attack
			lowest costing (base unit, free first one?)
			Currently feels really weak
			Change:
				Pircing
				by UI??
		Gunner:
			Very high atk speed
			Low atk dmg
			Cost more then turret
			Currently feels strong 
		Octo:
			med atk speed
			low attack
			?? feels yes??
			cost around booma
		Booma:
			med atk speed
			low-med atk dmg
			feels misses a lot
			low-med cost around gunner maybe lower
		Rocket:
			Low atk speed
			med-high dmg in aoe
			High costing (Lower then sniper)
			fix rocket
			feels fine. If have good utility would feel good
			Explosion animation?
		Plane:
			High atk speed
			med-high dmg
			Low ammounts bought
			Very expensive
			Feels very strong but not consistant dmg (if expensive good)
		Sniper: (maybe turn into a rail gun)
			Very high dmg
			Very low atk speed
			setting to atk highest hp unit?
			Low ammounts bought
			Expensive (less then plane)
			Feels underwhelming. Maybe lightnight element for high dmg aoe?
